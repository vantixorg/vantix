# BulletImpactManager

`Vantix.Fx.BulletImpactManager`

Spawns a bullet-hole Decal3D and spark/dust GPUParticles3D at each hit point. Surface material comes from the collider's Godot group (e.g. "metal"); decal is skipped when no texture is configured.

## Methods

| Name | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `BasisFromNormal(Vector3)` | Builds an orthonormal basis where local-Y points along the surface normal (decals project along -Y). |
| `GetOrBuildMaterialCache(string, Vantix.Fx.BulletImpactManager.ParticleProfile)` | Returns the cached material/mesh bundle for a material key, building it on first request. |
| `GetParticleParams(StringName)` | Returns the particle profile (color, count, gravity, etc.) for a given material tag. |
| `PrewarmDecalsAsync()` | Warms all decal sets on a background thread at level load so texture packing doesn't run on the main thread on the first shot. Lazy path covers the gap until prewarm finishes (lock-guarded). |
| `RestoreGodotObjectData(Bridge.GodotSerializationInfo)` | — |
| `SaveGodotObjectData(Bridge.GodotSerializationInfo)` | — |
| `Spawn(Vector3, Vector3, StringName)` | Spawns an impact: decal (when a texture is available) plus material-coded particles. |
| `SpawnDecal(Vector3, Vector3, StringName)` | Spawns the decal node for the given hit using the material-specific pool with default fallback. |
| `SpawnParticles(Vector3, Vector3, StringName)` | Spawns the GPU particle burst configured by the material's `ParticleProfile`. |
| `TryPickValid(Array<Vantix.Fx.BulletDecalSet>)` | Random-picks a valid set from the pool, trying others in circular order; null if none valid. |
| `_ExitTree()` | Clears the singleton and frees the pools. Pool nodes are parented to SceneTree.Root (persists across scenes), so they must be freed manually or they leak on every scene reload. |
| `_Process(double)` | Hides decals and stops particles whose expiry has elapsed, throttled to `RecycleInterval`. |
| `_Ready()` | Registers the singleton, starts async decal prewarm, and pre-allocates the Decal + Particle pools (deferred so SceneTree.Root is reachable). Avoids a first-shot hitch. |
