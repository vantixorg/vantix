# Packets

`Vantix.Net.Packets`

Central packet read/write helpers. Each packet starts with a `PacketType` byte, then a type-specific body. Channels: Input + Snapshot are Unreliable (channel 0, drops discarded); all gameplay events and the handshake are ReliableOrdered (channel 1). Token is a variable-length byte array (GUID or auth token).

## Fields

| Name | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `MaxInputRedundancy` | Inputs bundled redundantly per packet. 3 covers 2 consecutive drops. |
| `MaxSubtickEventsWire` | Hard wire cap on subtick events per input body. Must match `NetworkPlayer.MaxSubtickEventsPerTick`; server rejects higher counts (cheat + bandwidth guard). |
| `NoBaselineTick` | "No baseline" sentinel (full snapshot / nothing received). The server starts at tick 1 so tick 0 never collides. |
| `ProtocolVersion` | Current protocol version. Bump on any incompatible wire change. v2: snapshot Pos/Vel cm-quantised int16; material a byte id. v3: delta-baseline snapshot compression (baselineTick + per-player field mask; input carries ackedSnapshotTick). v4: input redundancy (N bodies, dedupe by tickIndex). v5: subtick fire-timing (FireSubTick byte). v6: subtick movement (InitialBits + initial yaw/pitch + EventCount + N SubtickEvents). |

## Methods

| Name | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `Begin(Vantix.Net.PacketType)` | Allocates a new `NetDataWriter` pre-stamped with the given packet type byte. |
| `BuildMaterialIdMap()` | Builds the string-to-id lookup for the material table at type initialisation time. |
| `ComputeFieldMask(Vantix.Net.SnapshotPlayer, Vantix.Net.SnapshotPlayer)` | Returns the bitmask of field groups that changed between `cur` and `baseline`. Per-player hot path — struct-by-ref, no LINQ. |
| `DequantizePitch(UInt16)` | Restores a pitch angle in radians from its ushort quantisation. |
| `DequantizeYaw(UInt16)` | Restores a yaw angle in radians from its ushort quantisation. |
| `EncodeInput(uint, Vantix.Character.MovementInput, bool, bool, bool, bool, byte, Vantix.Net.SubtickEventEncoded[])` | Quantises + packs a sampled input into wire form, incl. subtick events from `Events`. EventCount is capped at `MaxSubtickEventsWire` (surplus dropped; held state stays correct). Optional `eventBuffer` is a caller-owned scratch array reused to avoid a per-tick alloc; it must outlive the struct's stay in the redundancy ring. |
| `GetVec3(LiteNetLib.NetPacketReader)` | Reads three IEEE-754 floats into a Vector3. |
| `GetVec3Quantized(LiteNetLib.NetPacketReader)` | Reads a cm-quantised Vec3 emitted by `PutVec3Quantized`. |
| `IdToMaterial(byte)` | Returns the material name for a wire-format byte id, falling back to "default" when out of range. |
| `MaterialToId(string)` | Returns the wire-format byte id for a material name, falling back to 0 ("default"). |
| `PutVec3(LiteNetLib.Utils.NetDataWriter, Vector3)` | Writes a Vector3 as three IEEE-754 floats (12 bytes). |
| `PutVec3Quantized(LiteNetLib.Utils.NetDataWriter, Vector3)` | 16-bit cm-quantised Vec3 (6 B, range ±327.67 m, 1 cm precision). For snapshot Pos/Vel only — tracers/directions need full float precision. |
| `QuantizePitch(float)` | Quantises a pitch angle in radians to a ushort (range [-π/2..π/2] mapped to 0..65535). |
| `QuantizeYaw(float)` | Quantises a yaw angle in radians to a ushort (range [-π..π] mapped to 0..65535). |
| `ReadConnectRequest(LiteNetLib.NetPacketReader, UInt16, string, Byte[])` | Reads a ConnectRequest body into protocol version, player name, and identity token. |
| `ReadDeath(LiteNetLib.NetPacketReader, byte, byte, byte, bool)` | Reads a Death packet into victim + attacker + weaponId + headshot-flag. |

Full snapshot when `baselineTick ==`. Returns false (drop + don't ack) if a needed baseline is missing. |
| `ReadSpawnAck(LiteNetLib.NetPacketReader, byte, Vantix.Server.Team, string, uint, UInt16, Vector3, float, Vantix.Net.InitialPlayerState[], Byte[])` | Reads a SpawnAck body into out parameters, including the array of already-spawned players. |
| `TryFindBaselinePlayer(Vantix.Net.SnapshotPlayer[], int, byte, Vantix.Net.SnapshotPlayer)` | Linear NetId lookup over the baseline players (n ≤ 16, so no dictionary). |
| `WriteConnectRequest(string, Byte[])` | Writes a ConnectRequest packet with the player name and identity token. |

| `WriteSnapshotInto(LiteNetLib.Utils.NetDataWriter, uint, uint, uint, IReadOnlyList<Vantix.Net.SnapshotPlayer>, Vantix.Net.SnapshotPlayer[], int)` | Writes a delta-baseline-compressed snapshot. `baselineTick` = `NoBaselineTick` forces a full snapshot (mask = All); otherwise each player is delta'd against the matching baseline entry. Caller must pass a baseline from the same PVS view. |
| `WriteSpawnAck(byte, Vantix.Server.Team, string, uint, UInt16, Vector3, float, IReadOnlyList<Vantix.Net.InitialPlayerState>, Byte[])` | Writes a SpawnAck (joiner's NetId, world info, spawn pose, initial roster). In competitive mode `yourTeam` is `Spectator` and the pose is ignored until `TeamSelect`. |
